          <h3>Restaurant simulator</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              The theme for the 2024 fall iteration of the Fuxi Game Jam was
              Metsola. Metsola being the old campus that we studied at before
              moving to Kantasatama. The game is a Restaurant simulator with
              some horror elements. The simulator genre of games has had a bit
              of a boom in the last couple years.

          <h3>The Game: What I worked on</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              I personally worked on The UI functionality, game mechanics and
              object interaction. Making a point and click game where the point
              is to get as good of a score as possible to get as much income as
              possible. A simple game which needs a lot of level management and
              object interaction. The game was inspired by an indie game by the
              name <span class="italic">Papers, please</span>.

          <h3>The problems</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              The project was simply put too ambitious. The student card
              changing for each student and the creation of the script took my
              co-programmer the whole jam to implement. The saving system was
              also something that had a bit of an impact on the game
              functionality but overall everything worked as expected.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              We didn't have the time to implement all the features that we
              wanted to, but we learned a lot. It was also our first time
              working together as a team. Overall the jam went without a bigger
              issue. We had 2 people who knew how to handle Github so we didn't
              even run into any problems with it. I am happy with the product
              even though we didn't finish it on time.
