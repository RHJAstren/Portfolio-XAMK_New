          <h3>The Project Management website</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              Piiska is the project management website which is used in the
              IT-Department of XAMK Kotka campus. The website is essential
              for the project studies which are present in all the bachelor
              studies of the IT-Department. I was a part of the development
              team for a very brief moment in which I was unfortunately too busy
              to be part of. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              As for what I was able to do was focus on studying about 
              full stack development. The way that I accomplished it, was by 
              taking part in Helsinki University's MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses)
              course aptly named 
              <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/" target="_blank">
                <code>Full Stack Open</code>
              </a>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="img-container">
            <img src="../img/FSO_Title.png" alt="Title card of Full Stack Open">
            <sub class="text-lg">
              The frontpage of Full stack open

          </div>
          <h3>Problems</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              The biggest problem that I faced throughout the project was that I took 
              too much work for myself so I wasn't able to work on it as much as I had
              hoped. The course itself was quite challenging. To start, I had no idea 
              of how the <code>React</code> framework worked. After working on the Astro.js
              project, I understood how things worked. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The course itself is quite well balanced. From the 15 parts, parts 0-7
              give enough exercises and knowledge to work on Piiska. It might be a lot of
              work, but it allows for a lot time to be spent on the project. While there 
              were no major problems with the exercises, it was still very useful to be
              part of the Helsinki University MOOC Discord, to see if there were other 
              students with the same problems as I had.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              From the parts, I was able to do until Part 2e and stopped just before 
              exercise 2.16. I am interested in picking up from where I had left off, but
              that I will probably do on my free time. As for what I was able to contribute
              for the project itself, was the README.md file. The file contains all
              suggestions and guides for a new developer that can then be modified as the 
              project continues and changes hands between students and developers.
            </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              It was a shame that I was a little too ambitious a year ago, but now I have a 
              better understanding of managing my time and what i should do next time I 
              try to tackle web development and my own portfolio development.
