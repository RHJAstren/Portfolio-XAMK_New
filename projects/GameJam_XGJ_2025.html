              Run around a liminal space to find easter eggs and to unlocke the true ending of the game.

            What I worked on
          </h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              The game was originally supposed to be worked on in Unreal Engine 5. 
              Due to some complications we switched to Unity on the first day. 
              The idea for the game was a brainchild of Kaspian. I was assigned to work on the UI
              as a Designer and a programmer. I made the detection and collecting scripts for the 
              collectable in the game. I also worked on the start, in-game and completion/kill 
              functionality of the game. I am also in the games cutscenes as an actor. 
              I also helped with audio set-up and the use of audio bytes and other audio 
              implementations for the game. Most of my UI design choices were done in co-operation with Kaspian.

        <h3>
          The Problems
        </h3>
        <div id="paragraph">
          <p>
            Problems began at the very beginning of the game jam. When my teammates started the project, 
            Unreal Engine 5 started to act up and caused my teammates to switch in the very beginning.
            I wasn't able to witness this meltdown as I was arriving to the jam 3 hours late. 
            After returning to the jam on the second day, I knew how to use the SFX audios, but I had no
            way of knowing how the music worked in the script. Lack of commenting the project lead to being
            unable to work on these things until my teammates returned to school. 
            These were the only major problems that we encountered during our project. Other one was the 
            use of the UI. The UI was well implemented but the construction and deconstruction of the UI panels
            was causing some problems with the kill and completion screens. Luckily we were able to finish the 
            project on time and had our trailer ready to be used.
          </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <div id="paragraph">
          <p>
            I am very happy with the project. We were able to do most of the things on time and we had a 
            finished product by the end of the jam. We were able to even sleep between development days!
            Overall, our development work as a team has improved significantly over the course of the game jams.
            This was probably the most fun I have had during a game jam as well. Trying out new things and everything 
            else considered, this was by far the best game jam I have attended.
