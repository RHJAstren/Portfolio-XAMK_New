          <h3>The Project</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              The portfolio was worked on to be a professional portfolio. It used a frontend development framework called
              Astro.js. Unfortunately there was a problem with the deployment of the website which is why I decided to abandon
              the website.
            </p>
            <h3>What is Astro.js?</h3>
            <p>
              Astro.js is a new type of JavaScript frontend framework. It is meant to be easy to use and use a familiar component style
              development pipeline. The components and the lack of having to write pure JavaScript made it very easy to use and learn. 
              The components can be then included into a layout that allows the developer to only modify the layout themselves. This 
              makes the development process seamless as well. Overall the development experience of Astro.js is very easy and allowed me to 
              understand how frontend frameworks work.

          <h3>Problems</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              The real problems of the project was with the deployment process. At first I intended to deploy the website using 
              <strong>Netlify</strong> which allows developers to deploy web applications in real time and update them when needed.
              The deployment process was supposed to be simple, however the service never let me deploy it due to a component type
              in the portfolio called a <code>slug</code>, which is a component that allows Markdown files to be rendered on the Astro project.
              The Markdown files contain all the information about the projects that I have been a part of, and contained information about
              the times and types of projects they were.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              This problem would persist when I tried to deploy the website on GitHub Pages workflow. GitHub allows its users to
              run a simple website on their workflow and the project should be named {userame}.github.io. This workflow is an easy way for new 
              developers to have a portfolio on the web without the use of an external server. While the workflow actually allowed me to 
              deploy the website, it could not work with the <code>slug</code> element and would not render the Markdown files.

              <sub>
                They main layout put in script. All yellow tags are a different component (eg. Nav for navigation,
                ContactMe for a simple contact region and Footer for the footer of the page.). This layout is 
                consistent accross all pages. The <code>&lt;slot /&gt;</code> tag is the place where the content of
                the page is situated.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              While the project was a failure at the very last step, I have a better understanding of how I can manage a portfolio
              after graduation. Also, having the knowledge of how modern frontend frameworks work is very valuable information to have.
              In the future, I will be using GitHub Pages to deploy my portfolio if I have no money to run use a service for it.
              Luckily the project wasn't for naught.
