          <h3>Description</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              An endless runner game. Goal of the game is to get as far as possible.
              Avoid the objects and the authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
              A flappy bird and Jetpack Joyride inspired game, with an added
              function of shooting.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Progress</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              The work started by making a Unity project as all other light weight
              work starts with. First of it was important to have a player that
              can be used as a placeholder for the main sprite. Making all
              placeholder sprites for the game took no time to make as they would
              be replaced in no time.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the placeholders were made, it was time to start working on
              the actual game. Started by making the main scripts
              (Playercontroller, enemy, and object movement) scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Work on the player script started off by making the player move and
              creating a "switch" -type control so that the player would change
              the direction of the movement by pressing a button. This is the main
              way of movement in the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, I started the work on projectile scripts. Intantiate
              from the tip of the character and destroy it after a certain amount
              of time to avoid overloading the game. With that, the enemy script
              was the next thing I tackeled. Making the projectile and enemy
              destroy each other simultaneously was the point. The obstacle
              instead would only destroy the projectile if hit.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the main players out of the way, it wastime to look into the
              barriers on the top and the bottom of the screen. Making the
              polarity switch at the same time as the movement of the player, was
              the main point.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now the game was running well. The next stop would be the to
              implement the score functions to keep track of how far a player was
              able to go and to increase the difficulty of the game as it
              progressed.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point the game was in its final stretch so I made the
              executive decision to make the game a Web and a mobile versions of
              the game. This was a good decision as the game would be a good game
              for PC and Mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
              Adding the sounds and music to the game was quite simple thanks to
              an easy to follow tutorial by Brackey. No problems here.
            </p>
            <p>And with that the game was complete.</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Problems</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              Here's the part what I dreaded the most. All of the problems that I
              encountered on my journey:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>The movement switch:</span> I had already an idea for how
                this could be accomplished with a boolean value, but because of my
                lack of Unity programming I didn't think of using a <code
                  >if(!insert boolean value)</code
                >
                if -function. This worked well.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Random spawn location:</span> While finding the spawn
                locations for all the enemies/objects was a simple task, making
                the random spawn location took a bit of time. Using a
                <code>vector<></code> type list, I was able to take the spawn
                locations of all initiated game objects and then using a 
                <code>for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++)</code> code line to pick any
                integer between 0 and 3 to instantiate the enemy onto.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Score manager:</span> I am not proud of this one, but the
                lack of UI programming on Unity really showed here. One stupid
                line of code broke the entire scoring system... that's all it
                took.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Player/enemy/obstacle speed-up:</span> This one was a bit
                different. Making a working function and then applying it to all
                of the game objects mentioned. This resulted in confusion and
                making it work properly took quite a while.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Switching from PC only to Mobile:</span> This is probably
                the biggest notable problem I faced. Due to how I had written the
                movement function, it messed with the touch controls for the game.
                I had to remake the whole movement part of my original script to
                accommodate the touch control scripts as well. The switch did not
                go very smoothly at first, but after I had identified what was
                actually happening, I just toughed my way through it. I managed to
                make great controls for both the PC and Mobile versions, which I
                will happily use in other games.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>GitHub:</span> Now by far the biggest cause of hair loss
                during this project. The version contorl. Not only was the making
                of a GitHub repository a pain in the ***, but then keeping it
                updated resulted in other stupid problems. Mainly the fact that
                the repo had successfully messed up the backgroung. Other
                teammembers were unable to use the version I had made due to this
                problem and they had no better way to fix it, other than making a
                new repository. This was infuriating at the time, but quite
                comical looking back at it now.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              The project ended with a(n almost) finished project. On my part the
              game was ready to be shipped. But now that I have heard feedback from
              my peers, I will tune the game a little bit to have the game be fully
              ready. The changes will be logged onto here.
