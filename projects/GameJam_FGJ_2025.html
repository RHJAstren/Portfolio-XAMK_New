              The theme for 2025s Finnish Game Jam was bubble's. Yes, I know you might be thiking:
              "<span class="italic">What about bubbles is scary?</span>", and you would be correct. There is 
              nothing really scary about bubbles. The game that we sought to make would follow a liminal space type
              in the style of <span class ="font-bold">Frutiger Aero</span>.

              I personally worked on The UI, it's functionality, game mechanics and enemy AI. I was also the version
              control expert and tried to keep a constant communication between the rest of our team mates.

          <h3>The problems</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            <p>
              The project was going great but we ran into an issue. The Unity colliders did not work as intended and I spent a lot of 
              time to fix this issue. I was able to fix the colliders in my own branch but onc once we merged the project into one,
              the colliders broke again and we weren't able to fix the problem. Another problem was the audio system I implemented broke
              after we built the project. We weren't able toi fix these issues by the return time.
            </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
           <p>
            The game jam went surprisingly well. We discovered new tools, fixes and were able to use our old works as well. Of course
            it sucks that we didn't finish the project on time, but we discussed with the team members that we could finish it at some point
            since the project as a whole was really succesful.
